<h1>Systems of equations</h1>

<h2>What is systems of equations?</h2>
<body>Systems of equations are the way we solve problems when there are 2 or more variable in a problem. Usually, there will be 2 problems to problems and you will be able to substitute or eliminate (Substitution and elemination is something we are going to learn about on this page) one variable, making it easier for you to solve a problem.</body>
<h2>Substitution</h2>
<p>Substituion happens when you can replace a variable for another variable to make the equation more solvable. For instance, you can replace if you have an equation that is y+x=7. you could replace y with x, so you only have to solve for one variable. It sounds confusing but I promise you it is not.</p>
<section>
Let's say you had the equation listed below.

<p> Since, it says y=3x-3, I would substitute the 5y for 5(3x-3). Our new equation is 2x-5(3x-3)=19. Then, we distribute making the equation 2x+15x-15=19. Then, I would simplify -the equation making it 17x-15=19. Then, we solve the equation by adding 15 on both sides and dividing by 17. Our answer for our x coordinate would be 2. We will plug in our x coordinates to solve for the y coordinate. The answer for our y-coordinate would be 3. <section>Here are a few practice problems.</section></p>

<ul>
<li>15x+y=19, x=y+2</li>
<li>17h+21e=109, e=h+3</li>
<li>4x+2y=8, x=4+y</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elimination</h2>
<p> Elimination is when you eleminate one variable by adding it or subtracting it (so they cancel out). This helps because it allows us to <i><b>eliminate</b></i> one of the variables so we can solve for the other.

<p>The two images above show different types of eliminations, so I'm going to walk you through how to solve those eliminations</p>
<h3>The first picture</h3>
<p>For the first picture, it's actually pretty simple. All you have to do is add the -10y to the 10y. Since -10y+10y=0, we can eliminate y from the equation. To make the equation equal, we have to do the same with x and the 14 and 6. Lets add -6x to 4x, that would be -2x. Lets add -14 and 6, that would be -8. So our revised equation is -2x=-8. So therefore, x=4. To solve for y, we have to plug in 4 for x in any of the 2 equations and we get y=-1. The solution for this equation would be (4,-1)</p>
<h3>The second picture</h3>
<p>In the second picture, you'll notice that nothing can be eliminated the way it was in the 1st picture. So we'll have to multiply. Let's solve for y 1st this time. So let's multiply the top equation by -2. That would be -8x-10y=-70. Since we want to make it equivalent, let's multiply the bottom equation by 5. that would be, 15x-10y=45. Now, there is -10y in both equations, making it realy easy for us to eliminate. Lets minus the -10y and solve for x. x=5. We can substitute x for 5 to solve for y which would be 3. Our answer is (5,3) </p>
Here are a few problems.
<ul>
<li>3y+5x=15, 3y+7x=21</li>
<li> 4x+2y=8, -4x+3y=12</li>
<li> 2x+6y=12, 3x+2y=6</li>
</ul>
