<h1>Forms of linear equations</h1>
<h2>What is the slope and y intercept? How do you calculate slope?</h2>
<p>In math, slope is the steepness of a specific line in the direction it goes. Slope is also commonly known as rate of change. The steps below show you how to find the slope of a line.
<ol>
<li>Find 2 points in the line.</li>
<li>Find the Y coordinate and X coordinate of that line.</li>
<li>Subtract the 2 Y coordinates.</li>
<li>Subtract the 2 X coordinates.</li>
<li>Divide them.</li>
</ol>
Y intercepts are when the line intersects the y-axis. Y intercepts are when the x coordinate is equal to 0.</p>
<h2>Slope-intercept form</h2>

<p>Slope-intercept is in the form of y=mx+b, where m is the slope and b is y intercept. It is really easy to interpret the slope and y intercept when a lines equation is slope-intercept form.</p>

<p>In the equation, y=7x+8, the slope would be 7 and the y intercept would be 8. Slope-intercept form directly shows you the slope and y intercept.

Here are a few practice problems.
<section>
Find the slope and y intercept.
</section>
<ul>
<li>Y=12x+15</li>
<li>Y=2x+6</li>
<li>Y=9x+10</li>
<li>Y=4x+5</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Point-slope form</h2>
<p>The formula for point-slope form is y-y1=m(x-x1), where y1 and x1 are the x and y coordinates and m is the slope. As you can see, this form is not as clear as slope-intercept but it's still very beneficial to learn. Unlike slope-intercept, this doesnt directly show the y intercept, it makes us work to see the y intercept. We have to convert it into slope intercept to see the intercept. The steps listed below help you find the y-intercept.
<ol>
<li>Use the distributive property of multiplication to get rid of the parentheses</li>
<li>Add or subtract(inverse of the sign written) y1 to x1</li>

That's it</p>
<p>In the equation y-6=3(x-1).The slope would obviously be 3. To convert it into slope intercept form, you have to distribute. Using the distributive property the new equation would be y-6=3x-3. Next, I will add 6 to -3. Now, the slope intercept version is y=3x+3 The Y intercept is 3.</p>  
<section>
Find the slope and y intercept.
<ul>
<li>y-3=3(x+2)</li>
<li>y+6=5(x+4)</li>
<li>y+1=6(x+5)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Standard form</h2>
<p>Last but definitely not least, standard form. The formula for standard form is Ax+By=C.
In this formula, we can't see the slope or the y intercept clearly (of course). Like point slope form, we have to convert it into slope-intercept form. Belw are the steps to convert it into slope-intercept form.
<ol> 
<li>Add or subtract Ax from both sides</li>
<li> divide both sides by B to isolate Y</li>
</ol>
<section>
Thats it!
</section>
For example, if I had the equation 6x+3y=3, I would first subtract 6x from both sides. My new equation would be 3y=3-6x.Lastly, I would divide by 3 on both sides. Now, my equation has been succesfully converted into slope intercept, making it y=1-2x. My slope would be -2 and my y intercept would be 1. 
<section> 
Here are a few problems, solve for the slope and y-intercept. 
</section>
<ul>
<li>8x+4y=16</li>
<li>4x+2y=10</li>
</ul>
<p>
You've now learned all the forms of linear equations. Great, we're done right. No, there's one challenge problem remaining, can you solve it?
